# Code-Optimisation
Goal: reduce computational cost without change the output

1. Arithmetic shift
  &	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
  |	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
  ^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
  ~	Binary One's Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
  <<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
  >>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
